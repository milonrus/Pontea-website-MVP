"Section 1",TMC,"Read the following passage and answer the related questions. Men tend to interpret love and marriage in terms of possession, as confirmed by studies of wedding ceremonies, prenuptial negotiations, adultery laws and love songs. Violation of men's property rights over ""their"" women can lead to violent acts. The vast majority of uxoricides are due to suspicion of infidelity or the wife's desire to end the relationship: the risk of a woman being killed is higher after abandoning a violent partner than during cohabitation. ""If I can't have her, no one will,"" uxoricides think. Role reversal is not very common. And when women kill their partners, it is usually in reaction to the violent domination of the man. Perhaps male possessiveness is due to the fact that men are in strong competition with each other for reproduction and can be deceived about paternity. However, men do not attack their partners in the same way all over the world. There are major cultural differences. In Papua New Guinea, an ethnographer revealed that in the Lusi-kaliai tribe, almost all women are beaten by their husbands at some point, while in the Wape tribe, violence is very rare. Even in developed nations, the situation is very different: according to FOMS, the number of wives attacked by their husbands varies from 10 to more than 50 percent. Every year, more than a hundred British men kill their partners or ex-partners. [...] In the United States, about a thousand women are killed by their partners or ex-partners every year. This figure is lower than the 1,400 murders per year in the early 1980s, but in relation to the population, it is still double that of Great Britain. This is surprising because, at the same time, women's commitment to the world of work and divorces requested by women have increased, both phenomena that are unwelcome to possessive men. The reduction in uxoricides could be due to the greater social protection guaranteed to battered women. The reduction in the number of men killed by their wives has been even more marked. Evidently, women's protection programs have saved more men's lives than women's: if women have the opportunity to escape from violent and dominant men, they are less likely to kill. According to the passage, a woman with an abusive partner risks being killed with:",5,"lower probability after partner abandonment","higher probability during cohabitation","less likely during prenuptial negotiations","the same probability both during and after cohabitation","higher likelihood after partner abandonment"

"Section 1",TMC,"Read the following passage and answer the related questions A mathematical concept of primary importance, numbers, were introduced, more or less consciously, since ancient times in order to be able to operate on quantities of elements constituting sets or on quantities expressing measures of material entities. The first written numbering dates back to 3500 BC among the Sumerians, in Mesopotamia. The current positional numbering, with nine digits and zero, was developed in India around the 5th century AD, but the decimal was not unknown to the Egyptians, Babylonians, Chinese and even the Mayans. However, the first systematic exposition is by the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in the 7th century AD. It was then the Arabs - with the mathematician Muhammad ibn Al-Khwarizimi (780-850) - who used them (as a concept but not as a writing) during their domination and only much later, with the possibility of making practical arithmetic results, was Leonardo Fibonacci (1170-1230) who spread them in medieval Europe, with his treatise ""Liber abaci"". Since they were notoriously ""used"" by the Arabs, they were improperly called ""Arabic numbers"", instead the actual writing was the Indian one. The Arab Muhammad ibn Al-Khwarizimi around 810 also wrote a book on mathematics coining a term that in Italian became ""algebra"". According to the author of the piece, the notion of ""number"":",2,"allowed the expression of units of measurement","dates back to antiquity","it was introduced before the alphabet","allowed to operate only on concrete objects","was introduced unknowingly"
